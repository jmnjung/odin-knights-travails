# odin-knights-travails

This project contains a function that calculates one of the shortest paths a knight can take on a standard 8x8 chessboard from a given start position to an end position.

The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the knight's possible moves and returns a sequence of coordinates representing the path.
